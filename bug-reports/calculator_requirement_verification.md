## Verified Requirements and Issues

| â„– | Requirement / Observation | Status / Notes |
|---|---------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Contradiction in functionality description. The app description is inconsistent: should the app add numbers or multiply them? (Requirement 1) | Issue found |
| 2 | Placeholder contradicts the allowed range. The specified range (-99 to 99) contradicts the placeholder shown in the image (100), which may confuse the user. | Issue found |
