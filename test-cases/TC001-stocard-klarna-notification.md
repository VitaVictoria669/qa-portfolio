# TC001: Stocard Klarna Transfer Notification

## Test Case Details
- **ID:** TC001
- **Title:** Verify that tapping Klarna transfer notification opens the relevant transfer screen
- **Priority:** High
- **Severity:** High (affects key user journey)
- **Type:** Functional Testing
- **Component:** Push Notifications, Deep Linking

## Test Environment
- **Device:** OnePlus 8T, Android version 14
- **App Version:** Version 10.67.0 #1210
- **Date Tested:** 05.06.2025

## Preconditions
- Stocard app is installed on the device
- User is logged into the app
- User has received the push notification: "Exciting News: Stocard is Joining Klarna! Take 2 minutes now to move your cards over."

## Test Steps
1. Observe the push notification on the device: "Exciting News: Stocard is Joining Klarna! Take 2 minutes now to move your cards over."
2. Tap on the notification

## Expected Result
The app opens directly to a screen that provides clear instructions or options for transferring cards to Klarna.

## Actual Result
The app opens to the default home screen without any Klarna-related information or call to action.

## Status
‚ùå **FAILED**

## Root Cause Analysis
**Initial Assessment:** This appears to be a **communication/UX design issue** combined with a **process/planning gap** rather than a technical defect.

**Analysis:** The push notification assumes user knowledge about Klarna without providing essential context. The notification fails to explain:
- What Klarna is (separate app/service)
- Why the transfer is necessary
- What benefits users gain from transferring
- What happens to existing Stocard functionality

**Evidence:**
- Notification content lacks explanatory context about Klarna
- No clear information provided about what "joining Klarna" means for users
- App functions normally (no crashes or errors)
- Missing functionality appears to be intentional omission rather than broken code

## User Experience Issues Identified
- **Assumption of knowledge:** Notification assumes users know what Klarna is
- **Lack of context:** No explanation of why transfer is beneficial/necessary
- **Missing guidance:** No clear next steps or information provided
- **Communication gap:** Technical "joining" language doesn't explain user impact

## Notes
- The notification message causes user confusion due to lack of actionable content upon tapping
- No guidance or hints are provided within the app after tapping the notification
- **Critical UX gap:** Users don't understand what Klarna is or why they should transfer
- This significantly impacts user experience and likely reduces conversion rates for the Klarna integration
- Suggests need for better cross-team coordination in feature releases and user communication strategy

## Recommended Actions
- **Immediate:** Add clear explanation of what Klarna is and transfer benefits
- **Short-term:** Implement deep link to informational screen about the transition
- **Long-term:** Review user communication strategy for major app changes
- If transfer feature ready: implement proper deep linking to transfer screen
- If not ready: provide interim messaging with timeline and clear explanations
- Review release process to prevent similar coordination gaps
